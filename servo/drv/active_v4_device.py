  Servo v4 is the MAIN device in servo, but it doesn't really control the DUT.
  It's just there for ethernet, managing the image on the usb key, and for
  charging.

  There will be a device connected to servo v4 that controls the DUT. We use
  either servo micro or ccd from the type c servo v4. It is possible for servo
  micro and ccd to be used on the same DUT at the same time. Cr50 won't enable
  ccd AP/EC uart when it sees servo micro is connected, because they use the
  same signals and will interfere with eachother. They can both be used with
  servod at the same time, but only one device will have complete control of the
  DUT at a time.

  This class is used to configure which device has complete control of the DUT.
